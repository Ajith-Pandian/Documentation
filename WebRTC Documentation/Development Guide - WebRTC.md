## Introduction
Thank you for your interest in the ooVoo Video Chat SDK. The ooVoo SDK encapsulates the technical complexity of implementing and delivering a high quality, one-to-one and group video communications service over the Internet under a set of easy to use APIs exposed via the SDK, making it easy for you to quickly integrate video experiences into your own apps.

The video service offered via the SDK is powered by ooVoo's proven and scalable global cloud infrastructure and already provides over 1 billion video minutes to millions of users per month.

Below you will find complete documentation for the WebRTC JS SDK that will have you up and running in no time. Documentation will be added for additional platforms as well, as soon as they are released.

Happy Hacking!

## Core Concepts
### What is WebRTC?
WebRTC is a standard for enabling Real Time Communications including audio, video and data transmission between two web browsers without the need for additional plugins.

### What is an Application ID?
An Application ID is an ID issued by ooVoo to a developer that is used to uniquely identify the developer. You should keep your Application ID secure.

### What is an Application Token?
An Application Token is a shared secret between ooVoo and a developer that is used for authenticating and authorizing an Application ID identifying the specific developer. You should keep your Application Tokens secure.  

There are several types of tokens you will need to familiarize yourself with. First, there are the two token types which let you authenticate to the service, Web and Native. Web token types are for servers and clients which are web based. Native token types are for mobile devices running iOS and Android.

There also Session tokens which authenticate you for a given period of time after you have authenticated properly. Based on which form of authentication you are using (client or server-to-server) you will initiate a login with get the session token as a callback. For client logins, you will first login with your web token, and then call Init which the returned sessions token.

For server-to-server logins, you will do the reverse, call Init with the web token and then login using the session token.

### What is a Development Application Token?
A Development Application Token is an application token assigned by ooVoo to a developer for the purpose of development. It allows the developer access to a limited scope development backend. Once the developer's application is ready for deployment, the development application Token must be replaced with a production Application Token to allow the application to access the full ooVoo production infrastructure.

### What is an ooVoo Video Conference?
An ooVoo Video Conference is where ooVoo video communication takes place. It is a logical entity representing the collection of resources allocated in ooVoo cloud and the client connections participating in the video call.  

Via the ooVoo SDK, each end user's application is able to open a connection to a given video conference hosted in the ooVoo cloud. Through that connection the end user application may choose to receive and stop receiving one, some, or all of the audio-video streams available in the conference. The end user application may also choose to send and stop sending its own audio-video stream to the conference over the same connection.

The ooVoo SDK also allows an end user application to query the video conference for information, and get status updates when the conference environment changes, for example, when a user joins or leaves the conference.

### What is a Conference ID?
A Conference ID is a unique identifier assigned by the developer to each ooVoo video conference it creates. In addition, ooVoo service internally creates a globally unique identifier to be associated with each Conference ID a developer registers with ooVoo.

### What is a Participant?
A Participant in an ooVoo Video Conference is a user who has successfully connected to the conference session. A participant may receive any or all audio video streams in the conference, as well as sending its own audio and video streams into the conference. The ooVoo SDK provides the developer full control of which audio video streams to send/receive by a participant.

### What is a Participant ID?
A Participant ID is a unique identifier assigned by the ooVoo video service for each participant in an ooVoo video conference, upon a user's successful connection to the conference session.

## Getting Started With the WebRTC SDK Package
### What browsers are supported by the ooVoo WebRTC SDK?
Currently the WebRTC Standard is supported by the following browsers:
- Chrome 35 and derivatives (Canary, Chromium, etc.)
- Firefox 30
- Opera 22
- Safari and Internet Explorer are not supported yet. We recommend upgrading your browser to the latest version to properly support our WebRTC SDK.

### How do I setup the ooVoo WebRTC SDK in my development environment?
In order to get up and running just open the demo.html file in any text editor or development environment. It is a barebones starting point which you can build around and in it you will find the necessary javascript libraries already included. If you'd like not to use the demo.html file then make sure you include the following lines in your own app:

```javascript
<script src="https://code.oovoo.com/webrtc/oovoosdk-2.0.0.min.js"></script>
```

and make sure to define the necessary variables as is referenced in the demo.html file.

### How do I deploy and run the ooVoo WebRTC sample app included in the SDK download package?
To run the WebRTC sample app, just place the files in a directory that is accessible from the document root of your web server. Make sure you edit the demo.html file or your own code to include your AppID , APP Token & conference ID (roomID), the following parameters are optional, (get default value): frame per second, resolution level and your name. Please follow the example below:

## Developing With the WebRTC SDK
Check out our developer portal and dashboard at [http://developer.oovoo.com](http://developer.oovoo.com). There you can generate AppIDs, tokens and track usage statistics.

### How can I get Application ID and Application Token?
Application ID and Application Token are unique identifiers assigned by ooVoo for each developer. They are required for accessing the ooVoo video cloud service via the ooVoo SDK. After you have successfully signed up to become an ooVoo SDK developer, you should receive email from us to verify your address. Once verification is complete, you will be able to log into the developer dashboard at [http://developer.oovoo.com](http://developer.oovoo.com) and generate AppIDs and Tokens.

Application ID and Application Token are the only way ooVoo uses to identify you as a unique and legitimate ooVoo SDK developer. You must exercise caution to keep them secure. If you ever forget/lose your ID and/or Token, please contact ooVoo by emailing to [sdk.support@oovoo.com](mailto:sdk.support@oovoo.com) or contact your designated ooVoo developer advocate immediately.

You will need two types of tokens for WebRTC applications. You will define a domain for your Application ID in the dashboard and then create two tokens. One token type is a Web token, this is used for web clients. The other token type is Native. This token type is for mobile devices which will be connecting to the same session.

>Please note that Web token types will not work on iOS and Android mobile devices. You must create a Native token for those devices.

### How do I connect my users in a video call?
In ooVoo a video call is technically named as "conference". Each conference is identified by a unique "Conference ID". To connect two or more users of your application in a video call, you simply put those users in the same ooVoo conference by having them joining conference using the same Conference ID.  It should be noted that ooVoo SDK does not handle the "signaling" steps per se between the end users of your application. It is up to you the developer to manage the distribution of the corresponding Conference ID to the target end user(s) by your own application logic.

### How do I Initialize the SDK/Client Side Login?
> Please note the changes to the initialization flow since the first release.

When trying to create or join a conference, you must first login in from either the server or client side to authenticate.

Afterwards, the starting point for your app will be to call the initialization function `ooVoo.API.init` as described below. This method is used to initialize and setup the SDK. You won't need to re-use this method, but you may want to customize the parameters used. All other SDK related function calls must be called after this one, since they won't exist until you do.

### Client Side Login:
`ooVoo.API.connect (params)``

Parameters:

Name        | Type    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                             | Default

onInitComplete | InitDelegate | A function that will be called once all data structures in the SDK are initialized; any code that should synchronize with the ooVoo/Conference session should be in onInitComplete().                                      | none, required

Example:

```javascript
ooVoo.API.init {
     userToken   : '{your-user-session-token}',
  }}, function(res) {
  if(!res.error) {
     console.log("Api initialize succeeded, now you can initialize new conference");
 }});
```

### Conference Creation
Once you have initialized the SDK you are ready to create a conference object. The Conference Object provides connection, local stream publication and remote video stream registration  which will be used to manage the conference along with the local/remote AV streams and browser event handling.

`ooVoo.API.Conference.init` creates a new conference object.

```javascript
var conferenceObj = ooVoo.API.Conference.init(params,onInitComplete)
```

Parameters:

Name           | Type         | Description                                                                                                                                               | Default
-------------- | ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------
params         | object       | A collection of initialization parameters that control the setup of the Conference.                                                                       | Can be null
-audio         | boolean      | Enable local audio stream on the conference For audio only session set false in addition to :params = null in setConfig                                   | true
-video         | boolean      | Enable local video stream on the conference                                                                                                               | true
onInitComplete | InitDelegate | A function that will be called once ooVoo.API is initialized; any code that should synchronize with the Conference session should be in onInitComplete(). | none, required

Example:

```javascript
var conferenceObj = null;
conferenceObj = ooVoo.API.Conference.init({ video: true, audio: true }, onConference_init);
function onConference_init (res) {
if(!res.error) {
console.log("Conference initialize succeeded, now it’s a good time to register the conference events");
   conferenceObj.onParticipantJoined = onParticipantJoined;
   conferenceObj.onParticipantLeft = onParticipantLeft;
   conferenceObj.onRecvData = onRecieveData;
   conferenceObj.onConferenceStateChanged = onConferenceStateChanged
 }
}
```

### How do I configure my local media stream?
Once you have instantiated a Conference Object you can now use `Conference.setConfig()` to configure your local stream.

```javascript
conferenceObj.setConfig(params,onConfigComplete);
```

Parameters:
