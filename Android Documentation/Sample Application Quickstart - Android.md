To authenticate, you can either pre-populate the AndroidManifest.XML file in the root project folder with your App Token, Back-end Url and ConferenceID or when “ooVooSample” is running on your device, go into the App settings fill in the four empty fields on the main screen in order to create or join an ooVoo video conference:
•	“**Application ID**” – provided to you by ooVoo
•	“**Application Token**” – provided to you by ooVoo
•	“**Conference ID**” – the name of the ooVoo video conference you want to join. If this is a new name under a specific Application ID a new conference will be created and you will be the first participant in the conference. To have other “**ooVooSample**” users join the conference, simply have them enter the same Conference ID string.
•	“**Display Name**” – a string that you want to be displayed under your video when viewed by other participants.

Hit the “**Join**” button and enjoy!
